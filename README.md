Jurassic Park, System Security Interface
========================================

A weekend project for fun to teach myself some basic bash scripting.

To interact with the interface, enter the following from the command line:

```
bash jp-system-security-interface.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter a command; from here you may enter:

```
access security
```

```
access security grid
```

```
access main security grid
```
